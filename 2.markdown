# Quick Start

## 2 Your First LFE Project

A project? Already?! It sounds daunting, but it's just one command :-)

Head over to your favorite workspace in an open terminal and do this:

```bash
$ lfetool new library my-test-lib
```

As you watch the output crank away, read on to find out what it's doing:

* ``lfetool`` created a skeleton project (of the "library" type)
* ``rebar`` downloaded all the dependencies listed in the new
  ``rebar.config`` file that was created for your project
* All the downloaded dependendencies were then compiled
* During the first step, a failing test case was created for you; now, that
  test case has been run in the test suite and the error has been revealed
  (TDD!)

### 2.1 Tests First!

First things first: let's get that failing unit test passing.

Here's the output we saw:

```erlang
**error:{assertEqual_failed,[{module,'my-test-lib_tests'},
                     {line,11},
                     {expression,"(: my-test-lib my-adder 2 2)"},
                     {expected,4},
                     {value,5}]}
```

We can see that our test expected 4 but it got 5.

Before we go further, be sure you are in your project directory:

```bash
$ cd my-test-lib
```

Let's look at the test by opening up ``test/my-test-lib_tests.lfe``.

Well, things there look good -- we should get 4 when 2 and 2 are added.

Let's take a look at the source module: ``src/my-test-lib.lfe``. Ah-ha! a
bug :-) There's an extra operation that's being done which we don't want.

To fix it, change this line:

```cl
  (+ x (+ y 1)))
```

to this:

```cl
  (+ x y))
```

Now re-run the unit tests:

```bash
$ make check-no-deps
```

And you should get a passing test:

```bash
==> my-test-lib (eunit)
======================== EUnit ========================
my-test-lib_tests: my-adder_test (module 'my-test-lib_tests')...[0.031 s] ok
=======================================================
  Test passed.
```

We'll talk about the ``make`` targets in a bit, but our target above run the
unit tests without recompiling all the deps; just our project files and
our unit tests.


### 2.2 Project Inventory

Okay, we've got our tests passing and our project looks healthy. But what does
it have in it?

* a README file in ReStructured Text
* a ``Makefile``
* the ``rebar.config`` file we mentioned about (this has all your project
  dependencies in it)
* a ``package.exs`` file for uploading your project to http://expm.co
* the ``src`` directory which holds your project code, and
* the ``test`` directory which holds the tests

There are some other things there (e.g., the deps directory created by ``rebar``
and the ``ebin`` directory that's created when everything is compiled), but
we're just going to focus on our stuff for now.
