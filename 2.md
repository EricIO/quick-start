## 2 The LFE REPL

     style="float: left; padding-right: 1em;">Did you just say "REPL"? What's a "REPL"?

"REPL" is short for "read-eval-print loop", what other languages sometimes call the "interactive interpreter." Lisp had a REPL (and interpreter) back in the 60s, when the designers of many of today's languages were still in diapers (or hadn't yet arrived on-planet).

The REPL lets you type LFE code and execute it on the spot -- no files, instant feedback.

Wanna give it a try?

### 2.1 Starting the LFE REPL

You're going to like this next part -- super-easy, super-fast:

```bash
$ ./bin/lfe
Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async...

LFE Shell V6.2 (abort with ^G)
>
```

### 2.2 Interactive LFE Code

Bingo! You're there. Let's have some fun. How about some math? Let's make LFE display The Answer:

```lisp
> (* 2 21)
42
```

Here's LFE's "Hello, World!":

```lisp
> (io:format "Hello, World!~n")
Hello, World!
ok
```

Wanna get functional?

```lisp

```

You can taste it, can't you? That *LFE flavor* coming your way? Yup, you're
right. You're going to be looking at LFE modules next ...
