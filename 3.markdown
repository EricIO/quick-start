# Quick Start

## 3 Using Libraries

### 3.1 OTP Modules

Taking advantage of the
<a href="http://erldocs.com/R15B/index.html?i=734#stdlib">Erlang stdlib</a> is
straightforward. All you need to do is prepend the call with a ```:``` and
adjust to use the LFE syntax vs. the Erlang styntax.

In fact, we've already seen an example of this above with the ```(: io format ...)```
call.

Here's an example ```base64``` usage from the Erlang ```stdlib```:

{% highlight cl %}
> (: base64 encode_to_string '"Space is big. Really big.")
"U3BhY2UgaXMgYmlnLiBSZWFsbHkgYmlnLg=="
> (: base64 decode_to_string '"QW5kIHNvIHRoZSBVbml2ZXJzZSBlbmRlZC4=")
"And so the Universe ended."
{% endhighlight %}

### 3.2 More OTP

The rest of OTP utilizes the same ```: <module> <function> <parameters>```
format. Let's take a more in-depth look, exercising some of the niftier
features of OTP, starting with a server:

{% highlight cl %}
{% endhighlight %}


### 3.3 Third-Party Libraries

Finally, accessing code that is written in third-party libraries is exactly the
same. Simply use the modules they have provided:


{% highlight cl %}
{% endhighlight %}
