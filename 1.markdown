## 1.1 Dependencies

First and foremost, you will need Erlang installed. On Mac OS X, this is as
easy as executing ```brew install erlang``` or on Ubuntu ```apt-get install
erlang```. You can also install Erlang from the various pre-built packages
provided on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">official Erlang
download page</a> or from the
<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp">Erlang
Solutions page</a> (supports many more package types).

[Editor's note: need to confirm the Ubuntu apt-get package name ...]

Next, you will need to download LFE itself:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rvirding/lfe.git
    $ cd ./lfe

## 1.2 Building

With the dependencies installed, we're now ready to build LFE.

### 1.2.1 Using ```make```

    $ erlc -o src src/lfe_scan.xrl
    $ make

Ordinarily, only the ```make``` command would be necessary. However, there's
currently <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/issues/14">an issue</a> with
the ```Makefile``` that temporarily requires that first step.

### 1.2.2 Using Rebar

Alternatively, one may use ```rebar``` to build LFE.
