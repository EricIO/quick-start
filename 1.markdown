# Quick Start

## 1 Getting Set Up

### 1.1 Dependencies

First and foremost, you will need Erlang installed. On Mac OS X, this is as
easy as executing ```brew install erlang``` or on Ubuntu ```apt-get install
erlang```. You can also install Erlang from the various pre-built packages
provided on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">official Erlang
download page</a> or from the
<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp">Erlang
Solutions page</a> (supports many more package types).

If you will be using ```rebar``` to build LFE, you'll need to
<a href="https://github.com/basho/rebar">get that</a> too.

You will need to <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download git</a> or
install it using your favorite package manager.

Next, you will need to download LFE itself:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rvirding/lfe.git

### 1.2 Building

With the dependencies installed, we're now ready to build LFE.

#### 1.2.1 Using ```make```

    $ cd ./lfe
    $ erlc -o src src/lfe_scan.xrl
    $ make

Ordinarily, only the ```make``` command would be necessary. However, there's
currently <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/issues/14">an issue</a> with
the ```Makefile``` that temporarily requires that first step.

#### 1.2.2 Using ```rebar```

Alternatively, one may use ```rebar``` to build LFE:

    $ cd ./lfe
    $ rebar compile
