## 1.1 Dependencies

You will need Erlang installed. On Mac OS X, this is as easy as executing
```brew install erlang``` or on Ubuntu ```apt-get install erlang```.

Note: need to confirm the Ubuntu apt-get package name ...

## 1.2 Building

With the dependencies installed, we're now ready to build LFE.

### 1.2.1 Using ```make```

    $ erlc -o src src/lfe_scan.xrl
    $ make

Ordinarily, only the ```make``` command would be necessary. There's currently
<a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/issues/14">an issue</a> with the
```Makefile``` that temporarily requires that first step.

### 1.2.2 Using Rebar

Alternatively, one may use ```rebar``` to build LFE.
